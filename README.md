# Using Feature Importance to identify metrics of concern in an application

This is a ipython notebook demonstrating how to use the feature importance of the ExtraTreesClassifier in scikit learn to identify which of the recorded metrics of an applicaiton contribute the most to a transaction being of concern.

We can use this technique to focus our investigations where the dataset collected is large and not readily identifiable.
